# Nonparametric Statistics Project: School Scores in Bogota

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing school scores in Bogota, Colombia, using nonparametric statistical methods. The dataset includes information about school performance over multiple years, as well as geographic data about the areas where the schools are located.

## Data Sources
- The primary datasets used in this project are:
  - `data_years.csv`: Contains information about school performance over multiple years.
  - `colegios.csv`: Provides additional details about the schools, such as their location and identification codes.
  - `poblacion-upz-bogota.geojson`: Geographic data representing the areas (UPZs) in Bogota.
  - WIP

## Tools and Libraries
- R programming language
- Required R libraries:
  - `splines`: Used for spline interpolation.
  - `ggplot2`: Utilized for data visualization.
  - `sf`: For working with spatial data.
  - `ggpubr`: Helpful for arranging and customizing ggplot2 plots.
  - others

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Read and preprocess the datasets, including merging and cleaning the data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the distribution of school scores over different years.
   - Visualize the spatial distribution of school performance using geographic data.

3. **Nonparametric Analysis**:
   - Apply nonparametric statistical methods to explore relationships between school scores and geographic factors.
   - Conduct hotspot analysis to identify areas of high and low performance.

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**:
   - Create visualizations to communicate insights from the analysis.
   - Interpret the results and provide recommendations for educational policymakers based on the findings.
